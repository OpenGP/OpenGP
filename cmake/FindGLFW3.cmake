# Locate the GLFW library (version 3.0)
# This module defines the following variables:
# GLFW_LIBRARIES, the name of the library;
# GLFW_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find GLFW include files.
# GLFW_FOUND, true if library path was resolved
#
# Usage example to compile an "executable" target to the glfw library:
#
# FIND_PACKAGE (GLFW REQUIRED)
# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES (${GLFW_INCLUDE_DIRS})
# ADD_EXECUTABLE (executable ${YOUR_EXECUTABLE_SRCS})
# TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES (executable ${GLFW_LIBRARIES})
#
# TODO:
# Lookup for windows
# Allow the user to select to link to a shared library or to a static library.
